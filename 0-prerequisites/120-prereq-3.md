# Cisco CSR Agreement


We will simulate your on premise gateway device using a Cisco 1000v. The Cisco CSR 1000v is a Virtual IOS-XE based Enterprise VPN Router. It can be used in your datacenter running on VMWare ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, Redhat KVM or Citrix XenServer. In addition, as we will see in this workshop, it also runs on AWS. The CSR 1000v supports the same commands, tools and logs as Cisco ISR and ASR platforms, whcih can also be used in your datacenter providing the Customer Gateway side of your AWS VPN connectivity.

<b>NOTE:</b> There is no extra charge for the software other than the EC2 instance charges. However, with no purchaced license, the Cisco 1000v will be limited to 100kbps throughput
