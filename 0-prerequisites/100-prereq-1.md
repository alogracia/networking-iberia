# AWS account access and VPC cleanup

* Admin access to an AWS account

* Access to one of the following regions in that AWS Account:

<pre>
- N. Virginia (us-east-1)
- Ohio (us-east-2)
- Oregon (us-west-2)
- Ireland (eu-west-1)
- Singapore (ap-southeast-1)
</pre>

* <b>You will need to remove all exisiting VPCs in the region you are working with</b>, so ideally this is a new account or one where you do not have anything deployed in one of the above regions. More instructions about how to delete the default VPC will follow in Lab #1. <i>If this is a new account or account provided by the workshop, you are in good shape.</i>
